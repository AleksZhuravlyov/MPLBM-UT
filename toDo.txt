name it according to density step function to create images at the begining, end and halfway at every axis.


-try geometry inizilization like perm

-decide an axis to inject and write code accordingly:
	-gifs
	-initilization

-change variable names to reflect behavoir
-set a variable to check how many iterations for convergence
-add variables for periodicity (vector)

-change convergence
